# ðŸ¥› Calcium
Calcium is an object-oriented C++ rendering engine.

#### Why Calcium?
Calcium is much easier to learn and use than OpenGL or Vulkan. It's aimed at people who want to create 3D games or applications but don't want to spend a lot of time writing and maintaining custom rendering code. With Calcium it's possible to see a 3D model on screen in around 30 lines of C++.

#### Platforms
Calcium supports Windows 10/11, macOS versions 10.13+, and any Linux distro that can install the Vulkan SDK.

#### Dependencies
- CMake
- The Vulkan SDK
